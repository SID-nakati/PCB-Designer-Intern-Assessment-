# PCB-Designer-Intern-Assessment-
This repository contains the complete submission for the internship assessment, covering both hardware (PCB design) and software (embedded C coding) tasks.
1) Hardware - STM32 PCB Module Design:
--------------------------------------
- The PCB design was created using KiCad.
- The module is based on the STM32G series MCU.
- It includes:
   * SuperSpeed USB-C connector for power delivery and data transfer.
   * 4-pin SWD debugger connector.
   * Two 4-pin connectors for sensors (I2C and UART).
   * One LED connected to a GPIO pin for board bring-up.
- All the required files for the PCB design are located in the "hardware" folder.
- This folder contains:
   * Schematic design files (.kicad_sch)
   * PCB layout files (.kicad_pcb)
   * Symbol and footprint libraries
   * Gerber files for manufacturing
   * Bill of Materials (BOM)
   * Electrical Rule Check (ERC) and Design Rule Check (DRC) report files

2) Software - Embedded C / C++ Projects:
-----------------------------------------
- The "software" folder contains:
   * A C++ program file to reverse the words in a string.
   * A C++ program file to blink an LED at three different speeds in a continuous cycle.
   * A video demonstrating the LED blinking simulation on Tinkercad.

All source codes are well commented explaining the key logic.

Thank you for reviewing my submission.
